Atos
====

Ruby on Rails gateway for SIPS/ATOS french online payments API

Usage
=====
1. Drop the files given by your bank in RAILS_ROOT/lib, so your lib folder should look like this :

  /lib
    /atos
     /bin
       /request
       /request_2.4.18_2.96
       ....
       
     /param
       /certif.fr.014295303911111
       /parmcom.014295303911111
       /parmcom.*
       /pathfile
     
   
2. From your controller, call the API like this :

  @request = Atos.request(
    :merchant_id=>'014295303911111',
    :amount=>'1500', 
    :customer_id=>YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID,
    :automatic_response_url=>"http://YOUR_SITE.com/ANY/LISTENING/URL/YOU/WANT",
    :normal_return_url=>"http://YOUR_SITE.com/NORMAL/FALLBACK/URL",
    :cancel_return_url=>"http://YOUR_SITE.com/CANCEL/URL"
  )

3. And then show the @request in your view, it's an HTML form 

---------- Let the customer pay you, then the bank respond -------------------------

4. Ok, now, you can catch the DATA parameter in response by listening to the 'automatic_response_url' you gave above

  response_datas = params[:DATA]
  response = Atos.response(response_datas)

5. Finally, you get a hash in 'response', that follows the API specs :

  response = { 
    :code               
    :error               
    :merchant_id           
    :merchant_country       
    :amount                 
    :transaction_id         
    :payment_means          
    :transmission_date      
    :payment_time           
    :payment_date          
    :response_code         
    :payment_certificate    
    :authorisation_id       
    :currency_code          
    :card_number          
    :cvv_flag              
    :cvv_response_code    
    :bank_response_code   
    :complementary_code    
    :complementary_info     
    :return_context       
    :caddie               
    :receipt_complement     
    :merchant_language    
    :language              
    :customer_id          
    :order_id             
    :customer_email        
    :customer_ip_address   
    :capture_day           
    :capture_mode          
    :data                 
  }
      
      
Notes
=====
- merchant_id, amount, customer_id, automatic_response_url, normal_return_url and cancel_return_url 
  are required to make a request, but you can freely add others (shopping cart, customer email...), 
  according to the API docs.
  
- Default language is set to 'fr' and currency to 'Euro', simply pass your own 'locale/currency' in 
  the request to override.

- It's conventions over configuration here, so strictly RESPECT PATH NAMES of the Atos files in the lib directory.

- Don't forget to check out the '/lib/atos/param/pathfile', and fill requested paths according to your 
  app absolute location on the server
 
- the '014295303911111' merchant_id I use all the way here is the test merchant_id, obviously, use you own merchant_id

Compatibility
=============
Tested in production with Rails 2.3.5, but should work with Rails 3.0  

Bugs
=====
Using Ruby 1.8.7/Rails 2.3.5 you can't just get the response with Atos.response(params[:DATA]), you have to assign 
params[:DATA] in a new variable, then pass it to the Atos.response() method. If someone could explain me why, 
I'd be curious to know more about it...
